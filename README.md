Proof of concept app that with the help of Pebble's developer connection opens another app on the top of the Health app, effectively allowing user to assign other app to the UP button.

Unfortunatelly recent Pebble Android app disables developer connection after 10 minutes, making this unpractical for unrooted users. For rooted users, app includes xposed module that fixes the issue.
